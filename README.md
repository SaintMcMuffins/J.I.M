# ProjectJIM

Goal:
Our goal is to provide an application that will guide the user while gradually improving efficiency and performance during gym workouts. 
We want people to get into the exercise world seamlessly and with as much support and proactive guidance as we can.  
We also want to give them the reins as much as we can to ensure the gains from this project are from their choices and not just a brainless guide.

Objective: 
Our objective is to create an application where the user is able to log in effortlessly anytime they go to the gym or exercise 
and its purpose is to monitor the user in measuring which exercises they should aim for as well as reps/sets as we set viable goals for the user.

Primary Objectives:
The app shall scale your workout after every session based on user feedback
The app shall contain a list of targeted muscles for a user to select from
The app shall create a workout schedule for users based on their needs
The app shall take in the user's information (weight, gym experience, preferred muscle workouts, etc.)
The app shall contain a database able to store multiple private accounts to ensure personal workout regimes

Secondary Objectives:
The app shall display calories burned
The app shall display a calorie calculator
The app shall display a short video on doing said workout

Inputs expected from the application:
To create an application to provide the user with the ability to choose their 
Fitness goals
Weight loss/gain (set desired weight goal), achieving PR (personal record) in weightlifting
Fitness experience level
Beginner (0 months-less than 1 year)
Moderate (1 year - 3 years)
Veteran (3+ Years)
JIMrat  (Go every day every hour every second) hidden achievement
Desired workout duration
Sets desired amount of days to workout
Sets how long each workout will be
Specified muscle group workouts
The user selects a muscle group to target,
The app will provide specific workouts for a selected group
Creating an accounting system for personalized use
Muscle recovery plans/tips
Diet (Secondary Objective)
Stretches
Users can provide feedback to enhance their workout experience and meet their goals (progressive overload)
Sensor on phone
Gyroscope sensor


Potential Solutions:
To achieve all objectives, there are three different aspects of the project. 
Rep/Set Counter
The application will need to detect and count when the user completes a rep.
Arm or wrist attachment that will detect the motion of completing a rep and adding it to a counter.
The app will utilize the built-in sensor on the iPhone.

Feedback/User adjustment
After completing a completed set, the application will need to know if the user can or can not do more.

After the completed set, the user interface will ask on a scale from 1 to 10 how difficult the workout was. 1 being easy and 10 being very difficult.
The wrist or arm attachment will attempt to detect the speed of the arm motion and will determine if the user is going too slow and mark it as difficult.

Weekly planner
The application will need to create and plan workouts according to the user's schedule.
Users will manually input hours and workouts into a calendar. 
Get user input like “availability and muscle group” and create an algorithm that will auto-generate a schedule for the user.
